How to use
___________

Using DnD Utils is pretty easy. There are a few databases, and a pair of tools for now. The databases include spells, traits, and equipment. The tools, a dice roller and health counter.

Alonngside those two dropdowns, there is a Home and About page.

Clicking on any of the database links, you get a list that auto popluates in the body. CLicking on any of the populated buttons brings you to the single item page that shows an indepth look at the current item you are looking at.

Clicking on either tool brings you to a simple module that has some buttons and some text. Clicking any of the buttons modifies the current state of the number above. The settings reset to zero when you leave the module.

Home is just a simple component that is the home page.

About is a small selection of links to the various tools and APIs used to build this site. It's finished off with a link to my LinkedIn
